//import ra.*; // my helper classes: ra.Heaps, ra.Haxe
import hp.HP; // heapspunk globals

// note: i decided to just rename the file because aliases didn't work when two ds'es were in the same file
// for example: GG.Layer didn't work, must use AppGlobal.Layer
//import AppGlobal as GG; // game globals
