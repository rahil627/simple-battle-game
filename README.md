# simple-battle-game
a simple battle game using heaps.io, to begin my long journey toward the depths of great fighting game systems  

for a long long time now, i've always wanted to make a lot of stuff using Haxe  
so, this is the start of that journey!..  

a journey into true programming  
with command line interfaces,  
shell scripts, and  
vim
